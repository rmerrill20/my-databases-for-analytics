## Instructions

- Use the **sqlda** database from the "Loading the Sample Datasets" instructions.
- For each SQL task:
  - Include your SQL in a fenced code block
  - Execute it and include a **screenshot** showing the query and results
- Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each answer.
- For explanation questions:
  - Write your answer in complete sentences
  - Include a screenshot if requested

## Question 1

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed
to show a **list of years** that emails were sent.

Your results should list years like this (order matters):

```text
year
2011
2013
2014
2015
2016
2017
2018
2019
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT 
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) AS year
FROM emails
ORDER BY year;
```

## Question 2

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to
show the **number of messages sent by year**,
ordered by year (as shown in the prompt).

Output should resemble:

```text
count   year
...
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT 
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date) AS year,
	COUNT(*) AS messages_sent
FROM emails
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sent_date)
ORDER BY year;
```

## Question 3

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to show:

- the **sent date**
- the **opened date**
- the **interval** between the two

Only include emails that contain **both** a sent date and an opened date.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT 
	sent_date,
	opened_date,
	opened_date - sent_date AS interval
FROM emails
WHERE sent_date IS NOT NULL
	AND opened_date IS NOT NULL;
```

## Question 4

Using the `sqlda` database,
write the SQL needed to
show emails that contain an **opened date BEFORE the sent date**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT 
	sent_date,
	opened_date,
	opened_date - sent_date AS interval
FROM emails
WHERE opened_date IS NOT NULL
	AND sent_date IS NOT NULL
	AND opened_date < sent_date;
```

### Screenshot

## Question 5

Using the `sqlda` database:
there are **over 100 emails**
that contain an opened date **BEFORE** the sent date.

After looking at the data, **why is this the case?**

### Answer

The opened dates/ times are based on actual local time when the customer opens the email. The sent date/ time are actually a default batch date/time. If you look, they have different dates but all have a timestamp of 15:00:00.

## Question 6

Using the `sqlda` database, explain in your own words what the following code does:

```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_points AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        point(longitude, latitude) AS lng_lat_point
    FROM customers
    WHERE longitude IS NOT NULL
    AND latitude IS NOT NULL
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE dealership_points AS (
    SELECT
        dealership_id,
        point(longitude, latitude) AS lng_lat_point
    FROM dealerships
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_dealership_distance AS (
    SELECT
       customer_id,
       dealership_id,
       c.lng_lat_point <@> d.lng_lat_point AS distance
    FROM customer_points c
    CROSS JOIN dealership_points d
);
```

### Answer

Each of these creates a temporary table. The first set creates a temporary customer table, ignoring all customers who do not have addresses listed. For those with addresses listed, it maps the recorded longitude and latitude to create a point. The second table does the same but with dealership locations. In the third section of code, the temporary customer and dealership tables are connected together. This, along with the code, allows for the straight-line distance between dealerships to be calculated and can show the closest dealership to each customer.

## Question 7

Using the `sqlda` database,
write SQL to display an
**array of salespeople for each dealership**,
sorted by dealership.

For example - dealership 1 is below:

```text
"{""Fidell,Granville"",""Onele,Jereme"",""Sheriff,Lelia"",""McSpirron,Massimiliano"",""Rennick,Nadia"",""Mace,Eveleen"",""Oxteby,Dukie"",""Spong,Marcos"",""Wogden,Quent"",""Duny,Sandye"",""Loraine,Englebert"",""Meere,Ira"",""Gibbens,Cristine"",""Prine,Lyda"",""McCoughan,Sheff"",""Schule,Giselbert"",""McAndie,Eleen"",""Dosedale,Dorie"",""Nafziger,Shay""}"
```

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
	dealership_id,
	ARRAY_AGG(last_name || ',' || first_name) AS salespeople
FROM salespeople
GROUP BY dealership_id
ORDER BY dealership_id;
```

## Question 8

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display:

- an **array of salespeople for each dealership**
- the **state** of the dealership
- the **number of salespeople** for the dealership

Sort by **state**.

Reference image:

![05-ExerciseArray](./instructions/05-ExerciseArray.jpg)

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
    d.dealership_id,
    d.state,
    ARRAY_AGG(s.first_name || ' ' || s.last_name) AS salespeople,
    COUNT(s.salesperson_id) AS number_of_salespeople
FROM dealerships AS d
JOIN salespeople AS s
    ON d.dealership_id = s.dealership_id
GROUP BY
    d.dealership_id,
    d.state
ORDER BY
    d.state;
```

## Question 9

Using the `sqlda` database, write the SQL needed to convert
the **customers** table to **JSON**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT
	row_to_json(customers)
FROM customers;
```

## Question 10

Using the `sqlda` database, write SQL to display:

- an **array of salespeople for each dealership**
- the **state**
- the **number of salespeople**
- sorted by **state**

Then **convert this result to JSON**.

Reference image:

![05-ExerciseArray-1](./instructions/05-ExerciseArray-1.jpg)

### SQL

```sql
SELECT row_to_json(dealership_data)
FROM (
	SELECT
		s.dealership_id,
		ARRAY_AGG(s.last_name || ',' || s.first_name) AS salespeople,
		d.state,
		COUNT(*) AS salesperson_count
	FROM salespeople AS s
	JOIN dealerships AS d
		ON s.dealership_id = d.dealership_id
	GROUP BY 
		s.dealership_id,
		d.state
	ORDER BY 
		d.state
) AS dealership_data;
```
