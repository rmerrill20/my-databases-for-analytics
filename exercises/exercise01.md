## Question 1

**Compare and contrast the data types used for:**

- `country.Population`
- `country.LifeExpectancy`

Why were these data types selected?

### Answer

The data type for 'country.Population' is int, which is a discrete value. Discrete values are fixed, as would be the value of the population. The data type for 'country.LifeExpectancy' is decimal (3,1) which is continuous, allowing for decimals and not quite full numbers. This would be the case for a life expectancy.
